This requires the Neo Pixel Blaster from here: https://github.com/synthiam/E-21_Neopixel_Blaster

The Blaster Bit connects to the E-21 Neopixel Blaster. With EZ-builder you can create colorful Blaster bit animations! A unique feature of the blaster bit is that it has a 5V regulator on-board so that it can be powered by higher voltages if needed. It doesn't need a dedicated 5V supply (but can run off of 5V if needed).
