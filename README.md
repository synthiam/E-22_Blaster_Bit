## Description

Out of our passion to solve the issue of time waste in the robot creation process, EZ-Builder was born. The EZ-Builder software platform reduces the time it takes to get from idea to implementation. Since 2011 we have been listening to the challenges robot builders encounter and continue to provide them with an ever expanding toolbox of solutions. Join us on this journey!

We didn't stop at the software, we also made time saving hardware solutions. This Blaster Bit reference design is one of them. The Blaster Bit connects to the E-21 Neopixel Blaster. With EZ-builder you can create colorful Blaster bit animations! A unique feature of the blaster bit is that it has a 5V regulator on-board so that it can be powered by, or protected from, higher voltages.  We want to share these files with you so you can create your own version for your community and customers to enjoy!

**Features:** 
- Output Connector to chain Neopixels using one channel
- 80 Blaster bits can be used per NeoPixel Blaster channel
- 5V tolerant data pin
- Can display 1 of 16 million different colors
- EZ-Builder behavior control available
- Voltage requirement: 6-24VDC (7.4V Typical)
- Current draw: WS2812B off - 0.5mA, WS2812B white - 39mA
- Dimensions: 16.3(W) x 18.3(L) x 10.4(H) (mm)

**Major components:** 
- WS2812B Addressable RGB LED
- AP2204K-5.0TRG1 5V Linear voltage regulator

**Manufacturing notes:** 
1. Manufacturer: Single side placement and soldering of SMT components
2. Manufacturer: Single Side soldering of THT components

**Note:** This reference design requires the E-21 NeoPixel Blaster: https://github.com/synthiam/E-21_Neopixel_Blaster
